# Software-Defect-Prediction-Research
## Objective
The Objective is to develop a new cross-project defect prediction model using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which would require less prior data to train the model[1].
## background
To be able to measure the quality of the code, we need to define the criteria by which it will be measured. this is commonly referred to as a metric, there are several metrics out there that can be used to measure the quality of code. One example is the Chidamber & Kemerer(ck) metric which uses 6 criteria to determine the quality of OOP code. One example of these criteria is Weighted method per class ( WMC) which measures how many methods a class contains, the more method a class contains the more specific it becomes which makes it less reusable, which means ideally a clean code would contain few methods per class [1]. Besides these traditional handcrafted metrics, the quality of code can be obtained through a classification model which looks at different aspects of the project [1]. One common type of classification model used for this purpose is a neural network. A neural network is a connection of node connected by edges in a feedforward mannered that replicate the function of neuron found in the human brain, the structure contains an input layer, a hidden, layer, and output later. typically this type of model is chosen due to its non-linear learning that occurs in the hidden layer of the network [3]. These techniques and methods can be utilized for defect prediction, which is the process of identifying a section or file that will likely contain errors/bugs in the future. There are two different types, one is within-project defect prediction and cross-project defect prediction. Within-project uses the same project for building and testing the model, as opposed to cross-project which trains and tests the model on a separate project[1]
